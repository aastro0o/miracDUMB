                        <p>This presentation is about facts, not teams. Yeah, I'll drag Democrats too because they're also corporate sellouts who care more about donor checks than actual people. But Trump? He's on a whole different level of terrible. Let's break down why.</p>

                    <div class="slide-text">
                        <p>Trump loves bragging about tariffs like they're some genius move. Reality check: tariffs are taxes on imports that companies pass directly to consumers. When he slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, American families paid <strong>$80+ billion more</strong> for everyday items. Companies didn't 'bring jobs back' - they just made everything more expensive. It's like charging yourself extra to own the libs.</p>

                        <p>Family separation wasn't an accident - it was policy. Over <strong>5,000 kids</strong> were separated from their parents, some permanently. Kids in cages wasn't Democrat hyperbole, it was literal. And here's the kicker: undocumented immigrants contribute <strong>$12+ billion annually</strong> to Social Security and Medicare. But sure, let's spend $25 billion on a wall that doesn't work.</p>

                    <div class="slide-text">
                        <p>The 2017 tax cuts gave permanent breaks to corporations and temporary crumbs to workers. <strong>83% of the benefits</strong> went to the top 1%. Your tax cuts expire in 2025, but corporate rates stay low forever. Trickle down? More like <em>trickle deez nuts</em> - nothing's trickling down except your purchasing power.</p>

                        <p>Bro literally tried to overturn an election by sending his fanboys to storm the Capitol. <strong>Five people died</strong>, 140+ cops were injured, and democracy almost collapsed because he couldn't handle losing. Man was having <em>boolymon living conditions in his brain</em>, thinking he could just cancel democracy like a Netflix subscription.</p>

                        <p>Trump praised Putin, Kim Jong Un, and MBS while insulting democratic allies. He weakened NATO, shared classified intel with Russians, and got played by every authoritarian leader he met. <em>Fakemink pigeon sitting on his head type behavior</em> - all flash, no substance, getting bodied by actual strategists.</p>

                        <p>If you thought first term was bad, wait until you see the sequel. Project 2025 wants to fire federal workers, weaponize the DOJ, and turn the presidency into a dictatorship. <strong>Schedule F</strong> would let him fire anyone who disagrees with him.

                        <p>Democrats are corporate-funded, performative liberals who talk big but deliver small. They bail out banks while people struggle with student debt. They're soft on corruption and weak on messaging. But here's the thing - <strong>they're not trying to end democracy</strong>. There's a difference between disappointing and dangerous.</p>

                        <p>This isn't about Republican vs Democrat - it's about <strong>democracy vs authoritarianism</strong>. Trump's already shown he'll break laws, ignore courts, and incite violence to stay in power. Project 2025 is the roadmap for dismantling American institutions. The stakes couldn't be higher.</p>

                        <p>Look, I get it - politics is exhausting and both parties are flawed. But one party is trying to fix a broken system while the other wants to burn it down and rule the ashes. Vote in primaries, support better candidates, but don't let perfect be the enemy of democracy. <strong>Stay informed, stay critical</strong>, and remember - fascism comes with a smile and a promise to make things great again.</p>
